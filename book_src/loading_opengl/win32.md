# Loading OpenGL With Win32

On Windows, turning on OpenGL requires... a few steps.

Honestly, it's gonna seem a little silly when I explain it.

Basically, Microsoft would rather that you use DirectX,
the Windows-exclusive graphics card API,
and so they don't really bother to make it *easy* to turn on OpenGL.
